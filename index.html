<h2> Employment; Previous and Current
</h2>

  <p>
    Currently employed as Musician, bar attendant, cleaner and gardener.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been willing to give anything a go. I think my resume reflects that. I taught music some years ago from mid year for 6 months at a P-12 school when they were unable to get a real music teacher. Mostly to the secondary pupils but a few hours with a large group of the primary school age students. It was a lot of fun. Unfortunately a teacher did apply for the position at the end of the school year and therefore I did not continue in that role the following year. It was a job that I look back fondly at and would not hesitate to do again.
</p>

<p>
I play music fairly regularly either on my own, with my band, Ally And The Cats or as a back up musician and vocalist. With the new knowledge I am currently acquiring I will soon get a music website up and running. For now I just have a Facebook page.

<h1>My Interest In IT</h1>

<p>
After an initial interest in the space industry and NASA as a child and into secondary school, but the discovery that only USA citizens could work there back then put a stop to those dreams, I avoided computers for years, total luddite until around 12 years ago when I got my first computer. I still only used it for emails and social media, a bit of googling, finding lyrics or checking chords in songs I was covering. But more recently I had to do some reprogramming of a Victron fully Off Grid solar system which piqued my interest. Amazing technology and definitely something I would like to look at more thoroughly.
</p>
<p>I have a friend in IT and I watched him working on a bulky old windows 7 machine I had inherited from my Mother. Wow! If only I could do that!!

<p>I saw an online advert for RMIT one evening and sent an enquiry form, the phone rang minutes later, it was a member of the RMT enrolment team whom I spoke with at length regarding career possibilities and what studies I would require to obtain employment in those areas. An introduction to IT was deemed the best place to start.
</p>

<h1> My Dream Job V My Ideal Job
</h1>

<p>I had to realise the difference between ‘dream’ job and ‘ideal’, one that is actually obtainable. I would love to work in the environmental sector but most require far more experience and education than is realistically obtainable to me at this stage in my life. Another field I have a great interest in is reconciliation. But the ability to work remotely is what first attracted me to IT and would be a huge advantage.

</p>

<p> 
The PDF attached is for my dream job. I feel it is totally out of reach but maybe in another life? Trust for Nature is one of the employers I will be sending my resume to on the off chance a suitable position opens up when I have completed my IT studies.</p>

<h2> Ideal Job</h2>

<p> These are possibly more realistic employment opportunities and ideal as they are work from home.</p>

<p> Any of these employment opportunities would require a lot more study on my part. But one of the fabulous things about RMIT is the career hub. They will be able to advise me as to where I could or should be heading to moving on from my current studies. Maybe there is a job in IT out there waiting for me now?

<h1>My Personal Profile
</h1>

<p> I quite enjoyed doing these tests. They made me feel good about myself. I know I'm supposed to take the results with a grain of salt but if it makes one feel better about ones self then so be it!
</p>

 

<p> The first is the Myers-Briggs personality test.</p>

<p> I wonder if I can squeeze my avatar in next to Barack? </p>

<p> Next, a learning styles quiz.</p>

<p> And in the final test, The Sorting Hat decided which house at Hogwarts I should be in. This was lots of fun and I'm so happy [and relieved] with the results. </p>
