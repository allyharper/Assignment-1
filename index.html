<h2> Employment; Previous and Current

 <div> <p>
    Currently employed as Musician, bar attendant, cleaner and gardener.
</p>
<p>
I’ve always been willing to give anything a go. I think my resume reflects that. I taught music some years ago from mid year for 6 months at a P-12 school when they were unable to get a real music teacher. Mostly to the secondary pupils but a few hours with a large group of the primary school age students. It was a lot of fun. Unfortunately a teacher did apply for the position at the end of the school year and therefore I did not continue in that role the following year. It was a job that I look back fondly at and would not hesitate to do again.
</p>

<p>
I play music fairly regularly either on my own, with my band, Ally And The Cats or as a back up musician and vocalist. With the new knowledge I am currently acquiring I will soon get a music website up and running. For now I just have a Facebook page.

<h1>My Interest In IT</h1>

<p>
After an initial interest in the space industry and NASA as a child and into secondary school, but the discovery that only USA citizens could work there back then put a stop to those dreams, I avoided computers for years, total luddite until around 12 years ago when I got my first computer. I still only used it for emails and social media, a bit of googling, finding lyrics or checking chords in songs I was covering. But more recently I had to do some reprogramming of a Victron fully Off Grid solar system which piqued my interest. Amazing technology and definitely something I would like to look at more thoroughly.
</p>
<p>I have a friend in IT and I watched him working on a bulky old windows 7 machine I had inherited from my Mother. Wow! If only I could do that!!

<p>I saw an online advert for RMIT one evening and sent an enquiry form, the phone rang minutes later, it was a member of the RMT enrolment team whom I spoke with at length regarding career possibilities and what studies I would require to obtain employment in those areas. An introduction to IT was deemed the best place to start.
</p>

<h1> My Dream Job V My Ideal Job
</h1>

<h2> My Dream Job</h2>

<p>I had to realise the difference between ‘dream’ job and ‘ideal’, one that is actually obtainable. I would love to work in the environmental sector but most require far more experience and education than is realistically obtainable to me at this stage in my life. Another field I have a great interest in is reconciliation. But the ability to work remotely is what first attracted me to IT and would be a huge advantage.

</p>

<p> 
The PDF attached is for my dream job. While the IT aspect is probably achievable it would require a great deal more study in other areas. Trust for Nature is one of the employers I will be sending my resume to on the off chance a suitable position opens up when I have completed my IT studies.</p>

        
<a href="tfn.pdf">Link to the PDF</a>


<h2> Ideal Job</h2>

<p> This next one is possibly more realistic employment opportunities and ideal as it is work from home.</p>

<h2>IT Software Asset Analyst - Work From Home/ Hybrid</h2>
<p>Tetra Tech Coffey</p>

<p>Adelaide SA</p>
<p>Business/Systems Analysts (Information & Communication Technology)</p>
<p>Full time</p>


<p>As a Software Asset Analyst in our Tetra Tech IT Procurement and Asset Management team you will be involved in the management of software asset lifecycle including acquisition, compliance, maintenance renewals, contract consolidations, cost control and decommissioning.</p>
<p>It’s a dynamic global team environment where all hands are on deck to support and service the business. You’ll be responsible for:</p>

<p>Manage requests from end users and vendors for software, approve or provide alternatives based on IT guidelines and respond to inquiries about request status, changes, or cancellations</p>
<p>Contact vendors to schedule or expedite deliveries and to resolve shortages, missed/late deliveries, and other issues</p>
<p>Work with IT Management to ensure compliance with company procedures and best practices while maintaining compliance with vendor terms and conditions to reduce risk to the business and respond to external vendor audit requests and administer proactive software audit processes</p>
<p>Work productively in a team culture and other team members remotely
Provide timely and meaningful inventory, deployment, usage, and availability information to business managers</p>
<p>Engage in the software support and maintenance renewals process and software inventory reporting to support negotiations in partnership with Vendor Management
Document processes, identify process gaps and engage in process improvement
Ability to present business cases to senior management for approval
</p>


For success in the role, you’ll need to demonstrate the following:

<p>You are good at organising and managing multiple priorities and/or projects by using appropriate methodologies and tools</p>
<p>You are a confident problem solver with the ability to encourage others in collaborative problem solving. You introduce new ideas and processes which improve performance and productivity</p>
<p>Negotiation experience and solid knowledge of purchasing methods and procedures is an asset</p>
<p>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</p>
<p>Advanced skills in Excel and presenting software licence data for review</p>
<p>IT Asset Management process and systems experience</p>
<p>Experience interpreting licensing terms and conditions</p>
<p>Experience within customer facing IT operations organisation</p>
<p>ITIL, ITAM and/or SAM training/certification a plus</p>
<hr>
<p>I have a little experience with Excel, my English skills are good and I am a good negotiator but I have no experience with any of the other requirements.</p>
 
<p> Either of these employment opportunities would require a lot more study on my part. I realise that I am far from qualified. As it stands at the moment I don’t even have an updated resume, something else I can do with my newly acquired computing skills, perhaps? It is a whole new ball game out there now job hunting. And it has been a long time since I needed to, work has found me for the last 15 years. I am not yet sure of what qualifications I will need for a career in IT. 

  But one of the fabulous things about RMIT is the career hub. They will be able to advise me as to where I could or should be heading moving on from my current studies. Maybe there is a job in IT out there waiting for me now?

<h1>My Personal Profile
</h1>

<p> I quite enjoyed doing these tests. They made me feel good about myself. I know I'm supposed to take the results with a grain of salt but if it makes one feel better about ones self then so be it!
</p>

 

<p> The first is the Myers-Briggs personality test.</p>                 <p><a href="mb.pdf">Link to the PDF

<p> Next, a learning styles quiz.</p>

<p> And in the final test, The Sorting Hat decided which house at Hogwarts I should be in. This was lots of fun and I'm so happy [and relieved] with the results. </p>

<h1>                             My Project</h1>
 
                            <h1>Bush Tucker App</h1>


<p>For some time now I’ve been wishing someone would bring out a Native Bush Tucker app. It would encompass all aspects of ‘bush tucker’. </p>
 
                                                      
        <h2>Contents</h2>

<p>1.  Traditional uses.</p>
<p>2.  Growing conditions </p>
 <p.2.1 Regions map/climatic zones
<p> 2.2  Tolerances, frost, salinity etc
<p>3.  Plant description</p>
 <p> 3.1 Annual, perennial,</p>
 <p> 3.2  Height, width, prostrate, upright etc</p>
<p>4.  Tips and advice from other users</p>
<p>5.  Warnings eg Kangaroo apple is poisonous unless fully ripe.</p>
<p>6.  Commercial success, e.g. macadamias</p>
<p>7.  Retail section. Eg Links to businesses with Bushtucker products.</p> 


<h2>The Uses For The App/Overview</h2>

<p>Say someone tries a bit of bush tucker while travelling. [I had a Quandong pie at Blinman in the Flinders Ranges, yum.] Maybe they did a bush tucker tour with fellow travellers at a national park somewhere.
They love that food! They want to grow it at home. Where do they find it? Will it grow at their place? How do they prepare it once it grown? All this information and more would be available on the app.  
It would have a welcome page with a searchable index listing of all the bush tucker plants. Each plant would then have relevant information and any retailers with that plant or a product produced from it could link their online listing to it.</p>


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The above mentioned Quandong pie! I have been trying to grow Quandongs for a couple of years now. They are so tricky!</p> 

 <h2>Collaboration</h2>

<p>I would need to enlist the expertise of a number of collaborators that have knowledge in the field. The app would require input for the different climatic zones across the country.</p>  

<p>Retailers of Native Bush Tucker plants could have a section where they can sell their wares.</p>
<p>Users would be able to upload data to the app.</p> 

                              

<h2>Tools And Technology Required</h2>

<h3>Hardware<h3> 

<p>  I would be using my old Mac. I was going to do an initial development for android but as I have been looking into app development more I have found there are app building platforms where you can develop apps for Android and IOS simultaneously. I am assuming that for the sake of the project the idea is to write the native code from scratch so I would write for Android. </p>

<h3>Software.</h3> 
<p>Appypie Appmakr. Software may need a compiler.</p>

<p>Open source. Github</p>

<h2>Outcome<h2>

<p>
The desired outcome would be that any user would have at their fingertips the ability to identify, procure and therefore use edible plants from across Australia. Whether they wished to actually grow the plants themselves, obtain any of the unique herbs, spices, fruits or vegetables, or even just learn about Bush Tucker the information would all be there in one place. Some states do have restrictions on the importation of plant matter but hopefully they would find a local stockist amongst the retail section. 


</p> 

<p>I have recently started a small Edible Native Garden. Personally, I would find this app very useful and hopefully others would too.</p>


                                                     

<p>Adjunct: A funny thing while researching this part of the assignment; I’ve been jotting down terminology and words that I have come across as I have been studying to find out their meanings and one such comment was Native V Cookie Cutter. When I googled it I ended up on a site that sells native animal cookie cutters, now I have to buy some!
